    summary: |
      Currently, I am a Software Engineer at Charles Schwab. I continually
      work to further my knowledge and polish my skills as a software engineer.
      I enjoy working on anything go, k8s, cloud related. I strive to refine my
      skills and better the software I work with on a daily basis to better 
      enable automated process orchestration.

      details: |
        Full time venture working on the Public & Private Cloud Delivery
        & Platform Engineering team and an internal tools building team. 
        I helped work on some proof of concepts with kubernetes (k8s).
        I also worked with Go & terraform to build internal custom
        terraform providers for an internal team to use. I have been
        fortunate to work with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and am working
        to automate process orchestration with the public cloud and 
        terraform. I am working to get my Certified Kubernetes Application
        Developer (CKAD) certificate along with the Scrum Developer 
        certificate. I am constantly working to learn as much as I can,
        attend as many trainings as I can, and continue to grow on my 
        skillset.

      details: |
        16 week venture working on a python validation script and a
        scalable CLI project to automate the pulling of data from
        Snowflake. I learned about System Level Testing and shortened
        the time engineers spent debugging diagnostic flows by creating
        a validation script. My main project was building a Go driver CLI
        tool from scratch to interface with Snowflake and automate the 
        pulling of data that the engineering teams would do on a daily
        basis. It removed the heavy lifting that engineers would do by
        choosing specific params and running SQL queries and manually
        transferring them to csv files to use. The Go driver automated
        that entire daily workflow in a containerized, portable way.
