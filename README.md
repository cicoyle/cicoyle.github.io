## Welcome to Cassandra Coyle's Website

I am a Computer Science major at Texas State University- San Marcos. I am currently working on furthering my knowledge, and polishing my skills as a software developer. I am pursuing Computer Science alongside my identical twin sister [Samantha Coyle](https://github.com/sicoyle/sicoyle.github.io). I am both excited and eager to refine my skills, and better understand how Computer Science is involved in our daily lives.
