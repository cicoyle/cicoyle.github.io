## Welcome to Cassandra Coyle's Website

I am a Computer Science major at Texas State University- San Marcos. I am currently working on furthering my knowledge, and polishing my skills as a software developer. I am both excited and eager to refine my skills, and better understand how Computer Science is involved in our daily lives. 

Use this [link](https://github.com/cicoyle/txstatecs) to view my school repository as I continue to learn and improve upon my Computer Science skills. 

Works well with [this collaborator](http://www.samcoyle.me).
